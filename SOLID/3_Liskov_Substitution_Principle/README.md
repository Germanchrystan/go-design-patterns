# Liskov Substitution Principle
It is named after Barbara Liskov.
This principle isn't really applicable to Go, because it deals with inheritance.
It states that if you have some API that takes a base class and works correctly with that base class,
it should also work correctly with the derived class.
The example in this repository is a variation that applies to Go.
