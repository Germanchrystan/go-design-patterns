# Adapter
Electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements. You might have different voltage requirements or different sockets types. If I have a laptop with a plug, I cannot modify the plug to suddenly support every single possible interface. This is where adapters come in handy. An adapter is a device designed to give us the interface we require.

In software engineering, we have this idea of an adapter as a construct which adapts some existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
