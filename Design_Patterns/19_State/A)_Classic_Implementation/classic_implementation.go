	of a simple state machine with just two states.

	Let's imagine a light, that has two state: on or off.

	Why can't we just keep everything inside us?
	Why should we have the state?

	The idea is that the switch stays the same, but we use implementators
	of this interface and we switch from one implementator to another.
	When we switch the light on or off, we replace the value or the property 'State' within switch.

		The state is already an off state.
		If you look at the off state, it does not have an off method.
		It has only an on method.
		So, by invoking the off method a second time, we are calling the off method of the base state.
